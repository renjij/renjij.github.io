      <description>2020, people say this year will be written in history books. From Australia fire to pandemic, from Black Lives Matter to US political drama, worse events showed up one by one. For me, at the stage of 26 years old, these really make me rethink humanity and my life philosophy. My personal life seems not to be influenced a lot compared to those in the centre of disasters. I even accomplished a few achievements that would be significant milestones in my whole life.</description>
